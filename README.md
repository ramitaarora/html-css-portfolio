# Ramita Indurkhya's Professional Portfolio
## UCLA Module 2 Assignment

## Description

This project is a professional portfolio page. It showcases my web development projects and provides means of contacting me.

This project helped me learn how to create a website from scratch with HTML and CSS. It is invaluable to work through creating the different sections and think of the design aspects.

My goals for this website include:

1. The website shows my background story and avatar.
2. The user is able to navigate through the website with the links.
3. The portfolio showcases the different projects I have worked on.
4. The user will be able to click on the projects and be taken to that application.
5. The website will be responsive and the user will be able to view the portfolio on any device.
